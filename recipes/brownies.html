    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>So, what are brownies? Some dude in ancient rome tried making a chocolate <em>cake</em>, 
      but failed because they didn't invent milk at that time. So basically he thought: "I gotta 
      melt some butter and put it in there". This recipe is special, it has a secret ingredient
    ... its mold. The secret is <a href="../images/mold.jpg">mold</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 and a half cup of sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups of low quality powdered chocolate</li>
      <li>1 cup of flour</li>
      <li>7 spoons of butter or margerine or butter alternative or melted pig fat</li>
      <li>A time consuming hobby</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix those eggs with your sugar</li>
      <li>Add your powdered chocolate and mix it some more, then add that butter and 
        <strong>INCORPORATE</strong></li>
      <li>Add your flour and mix it up again</li>
      <li>Now you need to remember you really like building model airplanes</li>
      <li>You end up starting a new project and it takes 4 days and you forget to eat in general 
      then you remember the brownie mix</li>
      <li>And, <strong>Oh shit!!!</strong> its all full of mold</li>
      <li>Put that sucker in the oven. I don't care what heat intensity, how long it goes there
        you can't really fuck it up more than you already have</li>
    </ol>
